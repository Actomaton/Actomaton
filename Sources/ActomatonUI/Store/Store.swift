///
/// - Important: ``Store`` is NOT `ObservableObject` thus its state can't be observed by SwiftUI views.
///
/// To make it observable in SwiftUI, use ``WithViewStore`` (SwiftUI View) to create ``ViewStore`` which is `ObservableObject`.
/// Note that ``Store/map(state:)-1wcms`` can narrow down ``Store``'s scope before passing to ``WithViewStore``
/// so that only the subset of state changes can be observed by SwiftUI, allowing optimized rendering.
///
/// ```swift
/// struct ContentView: View {
///     let store: Store<Action, State, Environment>
///     ...
///     var body: some View {
///         WithViewStore(store) { viewStore in
///             Text("Hello, \(viewStore.state.username)") // NOTE: Can shorten to `viewStore.username`.
///         }
///         // NOTE:
///         // This impl is OK, but it observes `store`'s entire state, which is not optimal.
///         // To only observe `state.username` change (for optimization whenever needed),
///         // narrow down the scope by calling `WithViewStore(store.map(state: \.username))` instead.
///     }
/// }
/// ```
///
/// For UIKit views, use `$state` publisher to observe state change.
/// To narrow down the scope and reduce duplicated partial-state update,
/// use Combine's `map`, `compactMap`, and `removeDuplicates`.
///
/// ```swift
/// let store: Store<State, Action, Environment>
/// ...
/// func viewDidLoad() {
///     super.viewDidLoad()
///
///     // Receive partial state update.
