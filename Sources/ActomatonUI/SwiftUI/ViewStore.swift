/// ``Store``'s `ObservableObject` proxy type that can create direct (state-to-state) & indirect (state-to-action) `Binding`s.
///
/// 1. Indirectly mutate `state` by ``binding(get:onChange:)`` and providing action "onChange"
/// 2. Directly mutate `state` by ``directBinding``
///     - Updated state that passes through this `Binding` will NOT pass user-defined `Reducer`.
///
/// Since ``Store`` is not capable of observing its state in SwiftUI, ``ViewStore`` is needed to be attached to SwiftUI view instead, either by:
///
/// 1. Create via ``Store/viewStore`` and attach to `SwiftUI.View` by writing
///   `@ObservedObject var viewStore: ViewStore<Action, State>`
/// 2. Use ``WithViewStore``
///
/// For example:
///
/// ```swift
/// struct ContentView: View {
///     let store: Store<Action, State, Environment>
///     ...
///     var body: some View {
///         WithViewStore(store) { viewStore in
///             Text("Hello, \(viewStore.state.username)") // NOTE: Can shorten to `viewStore.username`.
///         }
///     }
/// }
/// ```
///
/// - Note: Ideally, minimal size of `ViewStore` should be owned by `SwiftUI.View` for optimized SwiftUI rendering.
///   To optimize as so, use ``Store/map(state:)`` to narrow-down its scope before converting to `ViewStore`
///   via ``WithViewStore`` or ``Store/viewStore``.
